= LzOsUtils

This package contains a grab-bag of utilities that I've used for
writing OpenLaszlo applications.  It extensions in these areas:
* It makes OpenLaszlo JavaScript more like Browser JavaScript.
* It enhances OpenLaszlo with equivalents to some of the JavaScript
  libraries such as Prototype (whence the collection methods), and
  jQuery (whence the +ajax+ methods).
* It defines a powerful FlashBridge mechanism, for communication
  between the browser JavaScript and the Flash application
* Miscellaneous other utility features

== Browser Compatibility

* +console+ object: compatible with Firebug; can proxy to browser console
* browser compatibility: remove spurious warnings

== JavaScript Library Equivalents

More specifically:
* collection methods, compatible with ECMAScript 1.7 and Prototype
* +ajax+, +get+, and +post+ functions with jQuery-compatible arguments;
  option for proxying to browser console for cross-domain cookies

== Flash to Browser communication

FlashBridge object for browser<->flash communication with proxy objects
and async return values

== Other extensions
* xml syntax for filter effects
* a grab bag of functional programming methods
* a grab bag of view, string, and "multithreading" utilities
